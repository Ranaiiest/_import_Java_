JDK -- is the software development kit for Java, 
which includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), 
an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), 
an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), 
and other tools needed for Java development.

() Execution flow of java
1. java source code is first converted to a intermediate language i.e file_name.class
2. then the java program i.e jvm in the os ( either mac or windows or linux ) concurrently
    compile the intermediate code and execute it on the respective os.
3. it is a cross platform language but it is slower.
if we install jdk ( java dev kit ) then all the neccessary tools i.e the javac compiler then
jvm executer all will be installed.

--> java program execution starts from main function now the main function
can not exist individually ,a class contains it.

--> java has packages to organize their code files inside one package more 
files can reside.

--> to compile java program we use javac command
    javac package_name/file_name.java

--> to run the compiled java program we use java command
    java package_name.file_name or java package_name/file_name.java
